# SOEN 343 - Delivery Application Service
## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly delivery service application that simplifies the processes of requesting, tracking and paying for a delivery. Moreover, users can easily enter the details of the pick-up and drop-off of their delivery and will provide a corresponding price based on its specifics. Our web application lets users communicate with the service provider to ensure clear coordination and obtain real-time tracking status updates. Additionally, users can navigate different payment options for the service according to their convenience. Finally, the application has a fully-integrated real-time chatbot to provide users assistance.
